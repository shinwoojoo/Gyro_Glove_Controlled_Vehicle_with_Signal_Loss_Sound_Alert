## Project Overview

This project aims to create a vehicle that can be controlled using a glove fitted with sensors. The glove detects hand movements and translates them into commands for the vehicle. Additionally, the system includes a sound alert feature that activates when the signal between the glove and the vehicle is lost, ensuring safety and control.

## Features

- **Gyro-Controlled Movement**: Control the vehicle's direction using hand movements.
- **Signal Loss Alert**: Receive audio alerts when the connection between the glove and vehicle is interrupted.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Get immediate feedback on the vehicle's status through the glove's sensors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple setup and operation for all users.

## Technologies Used

This project incorporates a variety of technologies and programming languages, including:

- **Arduino**: For microcontroller programming and interfacing with sensors.
- **C/C++**: The primary programming languages used for the development of algorithms and control logic.
- **Data Structures**: Utilized for efficient data management and processing.
- **Markdown**: For documentation and project descriptions.
- **Git & GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shinwoojoo/Gyro_Glove_Controlled_Vehicle_with_Signal_Loss_Sound_Alert.git
   ```

2. **Install Arduino IDE**: Make sure you have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from [the official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

3. **Open the Project**: Open the cloned repository in the Arduino IDE.

4. **Upload the Code**: Connect your Arduino board to your computer and upload the code to the board.

5. **Connect the Glove**: Make sure the glove is properly connected to the Arduino and powered.

6. **Download the Releases**: Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/shinwoojoo/Gyro_Glove_Controlled_Vehicle_with_Signal_Loss_Sound_Alert/releases) to download any necessary files.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can start using the vehicle. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Power On**: Turn on the vehicle and the glove.
2. **Calibration**: Follow the calibration process to ensure the glove correctly translates movements.
3. **Control the Vehicle**: Move your hand in the desired direction to control the vehicle's movement.
4. **Monitor for Alerts**: Listen for sound alerts indicating any signal loss.
