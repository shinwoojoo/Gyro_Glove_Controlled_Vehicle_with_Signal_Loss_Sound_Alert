# Gyro Glove Controlled Vehicle with Signal Loss Sound Alert

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing a project on creation of a **gyro glove controlled vehicle with signal loss sound alert**. <br>
This project was completed as part of the Control Systems Technology course of my **Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features  

- **Glove-Controlled Navigation**: Operates a 4-wheel vehicle using a glove equipped with a gyroscope sensor, allowing for intuitive gesture-based control.  
- **Real-Time Wireless Communication**: Transmits movement data from the glove to the vehicle using a 433MHz RF module, ensuring smooth and responsive operation.  
- **Forward and Backward Motion**: Moves the vehicle forward by tilting the glove downward and backward by tilting it upward, maintaining a constant speed.  
- **Steering Control**: Adjusts the direction of the vehicle by tilting the glove left or right, enabling fluid and natural turns.  
- **Signal Loss Detection**: Monitors the wireless connection and detects when the signal between the glove and the vehicle is lost.  
- **Audio Alert System**: Activates a buzzer alarm only when the signal is lost, playing a predefined melody to indicate disconnection.  
- **Embedded Systems Programming**: Utilizes Arduino microcontrollers to handle motion processing, wireless transmission, and vehicle control efficiently.  
- **Motor Control via H-Bridge**: Implements an H-Bridge motor driver module to manage the movement of the vehicle‚Äôs motors with fixed-speed operation.  
- **Compact and Efficient Design**: Integrates a gyroscope, RF transmitter and receiver, buzzer module, and DC motors, ensuring a reliable and portable system.  
- **Comprehensive Project Resources**: Includes fully documented Arduino scripts and detailed images to facilitate setup.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites  

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding:  

- **Arduino IDE**: Required to read and understand code efficiently.  
- **Required Libraries**: Install the following libraries using the Arduino Library Manager: 
  - **MPU6050_tockn**: Required for gyroscope sensor integration.
  - **Wire**: Required for I2C communication with the gyroscope.  
  - **RH_ASK**: Required for handling RF transmission and reception.
  - **SPI**: Required for communication with the RF module.
- **USB Cable**: Required to upload code to the Arduino microcontrollers.
- **Power Source**: Required to supply power to the glove and vehicle modules.
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository. 

### Installation Steps  

1. **Clone the Repository**  

   To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/Gyro_Glove_Controlled_Vehicle_with_Signal_Loss_Sound_Alert.git
   cd Gyro_Glove_Controlled_Vehicle_with_Signal_Loss_Sound_Alert
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**

    Open Arduino IDE and install the necessary libraries:

    - Go to Sketch ‚Üí Include Library ‚Üí Manage Libraries.
    - Search for MPU6050_tockn and click Install.
    - Search for RH_ASK and click Install.
    - Ensure Wire and SPI libraries are installed (they are usually pre-installed in Arduino IDE).

3. **Upload the Code to the Vehicle**

    - Open vehicle_script.ino in Arduino IDE.
    - Connect the Arduino board inside the vehicle to your PC via USB.
    - Select the correct board and port.
    - Click Upload to flash the code to the microcontroller.

4. **Hardware Setup & Wiring**

    - Ensure the gyroscope sensor is properly positioned in the glove.
    - Verify that the 433MHz RF transmitter is connected to the glove's Arduino.
    - Check that the 433MHz RF receiver is connected to the vehicle's Arduino.
    - Connect the H-Bridge motor driver to the vehicle's motors and Arduino board.
    - Ensure the buzzer module is correctly wired for audio alerts.

5. **Power the System & Test**

    - Power the glove's Arduino using a battery or USB connection.
    - Power the vehicle's Arduino and motor driver using an appropriate battery source.
    - Tilt the glove to test vehicle movement.
    - Move the glove out of range to trigger the signal loss alert via the buzzer.
